Its often called New Chinatown because its almost as full of Chinese groceries and restaurants and Cantonese chatter as Grant Avenue, but most tourists overlook it, as did early S.F. residents, who wrote off the entire Richmond as a Great Sand Waste between the City and the sea. The Richmond did almost became a miniature Colma, housing the municipal and Chinese cemeteries. But after World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution, Irish and White Russian immigrants and Middle Eastern Jews bought homes in the area. Two waves of immigration after World War II brought Japanese residents and added to the sizable Chinese population. Since then, the Inner Richmond has become a bustling multicultural soup with cute stucco houses, grand mansions, easy access to the Presidio, a plethora of inexpensive eateries and a good variety of shops. The Richmond lacks the hype of the Mission, and the fog does roll in a little earlier in the afternoon, but on its main dining and shopping drag, Clement Street, youll find great Burmese, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese and Korean restaurants, Chinese bakeries that sell siu mai (steamed meat dumplings), BBQ pork buns and other dim sum for under a dollar and produce markets that offer bitter melon, several kinds of choy (greens) or 10 lemons for a dollar. Browse the stacks at one of the citys best bookstores, suck down some Hong Kong-style pearl tea (complete with marble-size tapioca balls) or sit down for a French bistro meal, and youll come to appreciate the modest neighborhood that has sprouted from the sand dunes.

Its most popular attraction is Lombard Street, which is known as the crookedest street in the world due to its seven sharp turns. Similarly, many of the sidewalks are stairways due to the steepness of the streets of this neighborhood. Russian Hill does have a lot of popular restaurants and shops down Hyde Street, and is nearby North Beach, which has even more shops. With significantly less crime than other areas of San Francisco, Russian Hill is a great place to live.

Its most popular attraction is Lombard Street, which is known as the crookedest street in the world due to its seven sharp turns. Similarly, many of the sidewalks are stairways due to the steepness of the streets of this neighborhood. Russian Hill does have a lot of popular restaurants and shops down Hyde Street, and is nearby North Beach, which has even more shops. With significantly less crime than other areas of San Francisco, Russian Hill is a great place to live.

This is half of the ground floor of a prominent building on the corner of 34th and Peralta. With approximately 600 square feet, there is room for an eat-in kitchen, a work area and a bedroom. The tall ceilings are over 9, and make the apartment feel even larger. It is quite sunny as there are large windows throughout. There is a gas stove and generous counter space in the kitchen. There is a brand new gourmet 5-burner stove! The apartment has red tinted concrete floors and a large sunny bathroom. There are only two walls in the studio; one marks off a walk in closet space, the other a storage space, so you will be able to arrange the room and to suit your needs. We have owned the building for 8 years, and during that time we have implemented extensive seismic and structural upgrades. We are looking for tenants with a positive attitude, who will contribute to the improving neighborhood, and to the great people who live and work on our particular block. The next door neighbors have started a small garden with potted plants and have a bbq out front. It is directly across the street from the main city recycling facility, so there is a lot of foot traffic in the area during the day. However, it is relatively quiet in the apartment and the recycling operation is closed during the evenings and weekend. The apartment is available immediately and we are comfortable with a month to month lease or longer. The rent is $950, while the deposit is last months rent of $950 plus $500 security deposit, for a total deposit of $1,450. This includes garbage, water, hot water, gas, heater and up to $50 of electricity (shared meter next door with a sub-meter). There are hookups for a stackable washer and gas dryer in the large bathroom. There is also plenty of street parking. There will be a showing at 6pm on Wednesday, June 26. Please email me to let me know if you will attend the open house.

While it is attached on both sides, the large windows and north/south facing windows, along with its many skylights give it a lot of warmth and natural light. There is a security gate that encloses a large entrance foyer. Inside the front door is another foyer with a closet and access to the large 2 car+ garage. Up the newly refinished steps lead you into the main hallway. There is a large living room with new recessed lighting, and a functioning fireplace. Next to the living room is the front bedroom. The bathroom is ideally located in the center of the home. There is a tub as well as a standup stall shower. Along the hallway are ample closets for linens and other storage. Further down the hall is the large master bedroom. At the rear is the newly remodeled kitchen with all new appliances including a Samsung gas stove and oven with a new hood and vent, new LG microwave, Bosch dishwasher, and Frigidaire refrigerator. All of the appliances are high quality, brand new, and have a modern stainless steel look. The kitchen sink, garbage disposal, cabinets, and granite counter tops are all new. It is a eat-in kitchen with a quaint, old fashioned spice rack in the wall and lots of natural light. Adjacent to the eating area is the additional room that can be used as a third bedroom, a formal dining room, a family room or an office. The garage is a two car tandem with space for a third small car, motorcycles, bikes, or just storage. Beyond the garage is another room which is partially improved. It could be a fourth bedroom, a guest room, an office, a play room, or just for storage as well. There is a concrete washbasin and washer/dryer hookups in the garage as well. There are also a couple of additional built in storage areas. There are no front yards in this neighborhood, but to compensate, there is a huge back yard perfect for someone who loves to garden. The north facing side of the home offers views of Bernal Heights, Potrero Hill, Sutro Tower, and if its clear enough, a partial view of downtown. The location offers very quick access to 280 and 101. There are a number of bus lines in close proximity as well as the Glen Park Bart Station. It is just up the hill from The San Francisco School which is a Montessori K through 8th Grade school. There are a number of other public and private schools in the area, a new library, a Fresh & Easy, lots of shopping on both San Bruno Avenue and Mission Street. While the overall square-footage per the tax records is 1,069 sf, the home feels much bigger and that figure doesnt seem right. It definitely doesnt include the first level. The home is pet friendly with an additional deposit. Available immediately. Please email to schedule a tour. ", "price": 3200.0}, {"hasPost": 1.0, "head": "267 W.

Shell info you that ED is very hard to get along with and that previous tenants have had problems with him and thats why the apartment is vacant !! RENTER BEWARE !!!!

Gas heater, electric range and fridge, windows in the front room, bedroom, bathroom, and a walk-in closet for lots of storage. the owner pays for water and garbage. Cable ready. The apt. is well maintained and will be cleaned upon the current tenant vacating... but the thing that sets us a bit apart from the average apt. building is our community. we know our neighbors, we see them, say hello, and visit with each other. We sometimes cook dinner together. We hang out in our backyard area and bbq, or play ping pong, or vent our frustrations about our GSIs. we are a mix of working professionals, retired elders, and students going to university. some residents are less social then others, and thats okay. but if you needed a movie buddy, or a pal for a bike ride, or a cat sitter, you wouldnt have to look far... And our biggest attribute is our grounds. we have worked hard to make our complex our home. we have landscaped our courtyard ourselves, we have cleared out parts of the backyard and put in a vegetable garden. we grow more tomatoes then our 22 units can handle. we have a fence line of blackberries that explodes every summer. we even have our own composting bins for our food scraps, which in turn goes back into our garden beds. other stuff we have available is on-site laundry (two washers and two dryers), weekly recycling pick-up, secure on-site parking (additional fee), and a bicycle storage cage. we are located near the corner of Grant and Dwight. a 10 minute walk to downtown. 15 minutes to campus. Equal distance between two Bart stations. Berkeley bowl is close enough to walk to as well... so hit that reply button. Shoot me an e-mail, and Ill pass on the info. about our open house schedule... thanks again for reading, and good luck in your search for your new home... L. ps. we also have a balcony unit opening on August 1st for $1350 & a Sept. 1st one bed/one bath opening. so come on by and take a look at the community and see what might fit your idea of your next living space...

He already posted an ad, but to help him out, I am posting an ad with pics of the inside of the apt. The place is in an amazing location: 3-4 minute walk to the lake! 5-7 minutes to library, the best farmers market in the east bay, Grand Lake Theater, Trader Joes, and all the fun shops and cafes on Grand Ave and Lakeshore Ave. Whole Foods and Downtown Oakland are also walking distance. The neighborhood is nice and there is always parking to be found, although I believe there is also a garage parking spot available here for $50 per month, if desired. One bedroom is very large with a huge closet. The second bedroom is small/medium sized with a huge window and a well-designed closet. There is a door that can be closed to separate the main living area from the hallway and bedrooms - which comes in handy if one person is up making noise and another is trying to sleep. There is a convenient balcony overlooking the street. The apartment gets SO MUCH NATURAL LIGHT. The pics were taken on a cloudy, rainy day, unfortunately, so that aspect could not be showcased. This is a secured complex. There is a gas stove and central heating. Garbage disposal in sink. The residential property manager is awesome, he will take care of any issue super quickly and even do upgrades if you ask. Rent is $1495 per month. Water and garbage included. Coin-op laundry on site. Dogs and cats OK with deposit and $15/month pet rent. To see the place you can call Fara at (408) 768-8570. He is also doing an open house on Sat June 29th from 1-2pm.

It is centrally located with affordable rents. The blocks closest to Market Street tend to be gritty with a fair share of homeless. However, the rest of the area has some nice pockets, with the best being closest to Nob Hill. Overall, the neighborhood is well located in SF and its popular among art students since you can find decent studios for reasonable prices. Its close to the theaters, Union Square, and there are some tasty ethnic restaurants.

Its most popular attraction is Lombard Street, which is known as the crookedest street in the world due to its seven sharp turns. Similarly, many of the sidewalks are stairways due to the steepness of the streets of this neighborhood.

This lovely house on a quiet street is coming available because the current tenants are buying a home. The owner has no plans to move into or sell this property, so you could live there a long time.

(the previous tenant lived there 10 years) (a) Its within walking distance of two excellent public schools, Del Rey Elementary, two blocks, and Miramonte High, 1.2 miles. (b) The rent is generally lower than for comparable houses because there is a second unit downstairs, with its own entrance. Its long-term resident is a quiet, retired grandmother whom you will like. She shares the provided laundry machines, and has a space in the two-car garage. There is plenty of parking. Three bedrooms (one quite large) and two baths, all on one level. Large living room with vaulted ceiling and fireplace, dining area, eat-in kitchen with updated appliances. Beautiful views and plenty of sunlight. Large front patio and back deck, usable back yard with lawn and space for a garden. There is an automatic watering system already in place. Lots of storage space. Unfurnished (tenants furniture appears in the photos). The weather tends to be cooler in the summer, warmer in the winter than in Lafayette, Moraga, Walnut Creek, Concord, Pleasant Hill, Alamo, Danville, etc. because of Orindas being first in line for moderating sea breezes.

Thanks to Integrity Real Estate Options, this is a new actuality that homeowners can take advantage of in order to keep hold of the most money from their sale. For a low flat fee, sellers of Bay Area properties can also retain the services of one of the leading real estate firms in the region, at a price that was previously unheard of. A seller will typically part with 6% of the sale -- 3% to the buyers agent and 3% to their own agent. While this percentage had grown over time, and during healthier economic climates, it feels incredibly disproportionate during this financially troubled period of the market. Sellers deserve to keep as much equity from their sale as possible, and thus Integrity Real Estate Options has lowered its fee to 1% in order to meet the challenges and needs of its clientele. Currently it is the only existing flat fee Bay Area real estate firm in the region. Take Advantage of a Top Bay Area Full Service Brokerage Offering 1% Listing Fees Its not enough to simply put your home on the MLS listings or anywhere else.

This 3-level townhouse is a modern architects dream. The entire building has 4 private town homes intelligently designed side-by-side with 2 in the front and 2 in the back. The home for rent is a 4 bedroom 2.5 bath; approximately 2,600 sq ft. back unit. However, due to the Zen south gardens on each level, the space feels much bigger. When you enter this home from a squared central courtyard, the first noticeable item is the 3-story-high vestibule that contains a sculptural spiral steel stairway with translucent treds. . .and could truly be considered a piece of art. It is magnificent. The kitchen is absolutely top-of-the-line. The entertaining space on the first floor was designed for an open and airy feel. . .or if you want privacy, there are doors that can be shut. This town home is so rich in feel due to the materials selected and its unique design for San Francisco, it was just recently featured in the November 6, 2005 SF Chronicle Design Section. (Living in a Bento Box - An Asian-style townhouse for a fashion designer from New Zealand) Of course there is an in-unit washer/dryer and one parking space in a garage. This is an extremely rare opportunity to shed your Pacific Heights traditionalist architectural life-style, yet live close to Sacramento Street in an incredible contemporary work of architecture.

Spend a Saturday hanging out in the relaxed and unpretentious downtown and youll see why. You can sunbathe in the park, take a yoga class, grab dinner, and see a live band or movie all within a radius of a few blocks. The range of businesses is really pretty extensive for such a small downtown, with an organic market, traditional grocery store, a brewery, bakery, ice cream parlor, clothing stores, hardware store, nursery, bike shops, surf shop, and more. Residents wouldnt tolerate big chains coming into town, so everything has a friendly, local feel. With a variety of restaurants, a nightclub, and several bars its a pretty happening spot at night by Marin standards, but its the abundance of warm days and outdoor activities that really seal the deal. Fairfax is surrounded by natural beauty with some of the best hiking and mountain biking trails in the Bay Area, so on weekends people come from all over to join in the fun, and this quaint little town still exudes the sense of community and respect for individuality that put Marin County on the map.

The property gets a lot of sun, but the house itself is shaded by the trees. It has one large room downstairs that functions as a combo kitchen/dining/living room. Upstairs are 2 bedrooms and 1 full bath with clawfoot tub. Rent includes all utilities except phones. Excellent broadband internet (comcast) is included. No cell phone service (any carrier). 20 minute drive to downtown Santa Cruz. Cigarette smoking or dogs are not a fit for this situation. If you are interested please answer the following questions: What are you looking for in a home? Have you ever lived in community? Do you have any pets? Are you comfortable with nudity? What do you do for personal or spiritual growth? What artistic outlets do you have? What are your main hobbies? What do you do for work? Thanks for responding. We look forward to meeting you if it seems like we might be a good fit.
