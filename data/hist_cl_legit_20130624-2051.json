Built on a grand scale and designed on two levels, this elegant house-like residence is perched high above vibrant Castro Street, overlooking both Noe and Eureka Valleys. The open, flowing floor plan is ideal for entertaining or simply retreating to the family room to enjoy the sweet garden outlook. Some of the many specialized features of this home include a gourment kitchen, nine and a half foot ceilings, custom bookshelves, and both gas and wood-burning fireplaces. The Master Bedroom has sweeping views, as well as a generous double closet and Master Bath. The striking hallway with illuminated, built-in glass shelves leads to the two large rear bedrooms, each of them stepping out to a charming rear patio. The property is semi-detached offering abundant natural light throughout, especially in the living room with its new gas fireplace. The front of the living room extends out far beyond neighboring homes, allowing panoramic views from both the front and sides of the living room that take in downtown SF and Eureka Valley on the left, Liberty Hill and beautiful Victorians across the street, and Noe Valley and the Bay to the right. The formal dining room and living room are grand in scale and design and connect seamlessly, making this home perfect for entertaining. Gorgeous deep brown walnut hardwood floors were recently installed in the living room, dining room, family room, master bedroom, and hallway, instilling a sense of grandeur and elegance throughout. The gourmet kitchen was remodeled in 2009 and features gorgeous granite countertops, maple cabinets, hi-end Thermador refrigerator and appliances, and an attractive new tiled floor, and opens to the rear family room. The family room, with a 60-inch Pioneer big screen TV and balcony, overlooks a serene flowering garden and is ideal for contemporary urban living. An attractive wine bar was added in 2010. The master bedroom has sweeping views of Downtown, Eureka Valley, and the neighboring Victorian Ladies. There is also generous closet space and a tiled master bath with separate tub and stall shower. The two rear bedrooms are nicely separated from the Master by a long, elegant hallway, with built-in illuminated glass shelves. All three bedrooms are very large -- each about 50% larger than normal comparable bedrooms. Both rear bedrooms have large closets and walkout access to the rear patio. This house-like residence is perched high above the flat block of vibrant Castro Street and comes largely furnished. Enjoy the convenient access of Muni (bus stop on end of same block) and also an elevator that brings you from street level to near the front door, so you can enjoy those amazing views without having to walk up numerous flights of stairs.

Just read this great Yelp review!- I have lived here since May 2011 and have had absolutely no problems. Although there has been a recent change of ownership, both the staff members that stayed with the new company and the new staff have been nothing but excellent. Everyone is super friendly and all maintenance issues, etc. are handled in a timely manner. The grounds are clean, the complex is gated and safe, and we have made many friends here. I can not say enough about how wonderful the office and maintenance staff are. Super sweet group of people. There are community events where you can have a great time and it is very dog friendly. (even for big dogs like ours) The units have a lot of storage for apartments and there are also garages available.The pool/hot tub/ bbq areas are also a lot of fun in the summer.

About the Neighborhood Macondray Lane, named after the Scottish seaman Captain Frederick William Macondray, is an historic pedestrian-only lane a half block from the summit of Russian Hill and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Macondray Lane has long captured the hearts of San Franciscans and visitors with its thicket lined tract, alluring cottages, and engaging gardens on the south side of the public path. Throughout the lane, informal landscaped gardens began early in the twentieth century and blend together to create a unique, romantic urban landscape. The Lane was an early enclave for artists and writers, including California Poet Laureate Ina Coolbirth, who was rumored to have been courted by Mark Twain here in the 1860s. In the late 1970s, Macondray Lane was memorialized as Barbary Lane in Armistead Maupins Tales of the City. It was here that one of the main characters, a marijuana growing land-lady named Mrs. Madrigal, chained herself to the wooden Taylor Street stairs to prevent the City from replacing them with concrete steps. One of the founders of the California Communist Party, Charlotte Whitney, lived next door to the property from 1927 to 1945. Public Transportation and Parking Most guests find they do not need a car as there is a Green Grocer, Wine Shop and the Searchlight Market within a few blocks, however we do provide parking for 1-car in a private garage \u02dd block away.

Although there has been a recent change of ownership, both the staff members that stayed with the new company and the new staff have been nothing but excellent. Everyone is super friendly and all maintenance issues, etc. are handled in a timely manner. The grounds are clean, the complex is gated and safe, and we have made many friends here. I can not say enough about how wonderful the office and maintenance staff are. Super sweet group of people. There are community events where you can have a great time and it is very dog friendly. (even for big dogs like ours) The units have a lot of storage for apartments and there are also garages available.The pool/hot tub/ bbq areas are also a lot of fun in the summer.

Though it serves more like a one-bedroom than a studio, it does not have a door enclosing the bedroom off from the remaining living space, so technically it is listed as a studio. However, the layout is such that it provides a remarkable amount of privacy; not that privacy should be much needed if living alone. Although it would work for a couple, this unit is more ideally suited for one individual given the overall size, 700sqft. Water and garbage are included in the rent. One year lease required and $1,000 security deposit due before move-in. *One designated parking spot in gated garage. *Gated condo complex. *Tall ceilings with track lighting. *Radiant heated flooring. *GE energy efficient stainless steel appliances: gas range, bottom freezer refrigerator, dishwasher and microwave (with the appliances and radiant heating, the PG&E; bill will rarely exceed $20 per month. The unit currently averages about $13-15 per month!). *High efficiency washer/dryer in the unit. *Granite counter tops in kitchen and bathroom. *Brazilian cherry hardwood floors in main living area. *Carpet floor in the bedroom/sleeping alcove. *Tile in the bathroom. No A/C but I have never had a need for it. Large school style windows swing open for cross-ventilation. Temperatures are very mild. No balcony or patio area. No pets. No smokers. No storage. Smaller closet (might run into some issues if youre a clothes horse). About the location: Perfect for professional commuting to SF or downtown Oakland. Even better/closer for someone working in the Emeryville business corridor (Pixar/Novartis/Zip/Jamba Juice/Peets/Whole Foods). MacArthur BART is 5 blocks away, a short 8-10 minute walk.

Although there has been a recent change of ownership, both the staff members that stayed with the new company and the new staff have been nothing but excellent. Everyone is super friendly and all maintenance issues, etc. are handled in a timely manner. The grounds are clean, the complex is gated and safe, and we have made many friends here. I can not say enough about how wonderful the office and maintenance staff are. Super sweet group of people. There are community events where you can have a great time and it is very dog friendly. (even for big dogs like ours) The units have a lot of storage for apartments and there are also garages available.The pool/hot tub/ bbq areas are also a lot of fun in the summer.

This lovely house on a quiet street is coming available because the current tenants are buying a home. The owner has no plans to move into or sell this property, so it could be yours for a long time. Why is this house such a good deal, where tenants tend to stay for numerous years at a time? (the previous tenant lived there 10 years) (a) Its within walking distance of two excellent public schools, Del Rey Elementary, two blocks, and Miramonte High, 1.2 miles. (b) The rent is generally lower than for comparable houses because there is a second unit downstairs, with its own entrance. Its long-term resident is a quiet, retired grandmother whom you will like. She shares the provided laundry machines, and has a space in the two-car garage. There is plenty of parking. Three bedrooms (one quite large) and two baths, all on one level. Large living room with vaulted ceiling and fireplace, dining area, eat-in kitchen with updated appliances. Beautiful views and plenty of sunlight. Large front patio and back deck, usable back yard with lawn and space for a garden. There is an automatic watering system already in place. Lots of storage space. Unfurnished (tenants furniture appears in the photos). The weather tends to be cooler in the summer, warmer in the winter than in Lafayette, Moraga, Walnut Creek, Concord, Pleasant Hill, Alamo, Danville, etc. because of Orindas being first in line for moderating sea breezes.

One year lease required. Please read this entire ad before contacting me. (That will save us both same back-and-forth over email.) Four photos are below, but you can see more photos here: http://www.lonestartours.com/trevorlevine/5740maccall/ - 650 square feet (bigger than many 2-bedroom apartments) - Ground floor of a quiet triplex - Sunny windows on three sides - Two closets - Enormous kitchen with granite counters and huge sunny window - Private fenced yard area - Offstreet parking - Easy street parking for your guests Also, the front door opens to the yard. So unlike condos in larger complexes UPS can deliver packages directly to your front door (instead of leaving yellow sticky notes, and making you pick up your packages). There is no laundry in the building, but theres a door-to-door laundry service I use. They pick up your dirty laundry, wash, dry, fold, and return it perfectly folded to your door. Its about $30 for two weeks of laundry (per person). There are also laundrimats nearby. The only utility I pay for is trash pickup. You are responsible for water, gas, electric, phone, cable TV, etc. If you want to, you can chip in for a third of my high speed Internet bill and share my wifi. There is a very large closet in the bedroom, and a small closet in the hallway. GREAT LOCATION: - Halfway btwn the Ashby BART and Rockridge BART stations - 17 blocks from Berkeley Bowl - 7 blocks from the entrance to hwy 24 - Walking distance to the Nomad Cafe - Quiet street with trees, not a through street - The only people who drive here are the neighbors. Most neighboring houses are owner-occupied. That means most of the neighbors are mature and stable people. Its not a transient neighborhood. RECENT RENOVATIONS: - New double pane windows - New pergo flooring (looks like hardwood) - New paint - New fridge - New granite countertop - New stainless steel kitchen sink - New bathroom vanity - New faucets, doorknobs, ceiling lights, etc - The building features new exterior paint, gutters, and landscaping. Im a freelance writer who lives/works right above this apartment. I and the back tenant are both very quiet. However, I sing for 30-45 minutes per day, and you will hear that. I need a quiet environment to concentrate. Ive also promised my back tenant and my roommate that this is a quiet building. So if you have a very quiet lifestyle, Im willing to compensate you for it. The official rent is $1499, but I offer a good tenant rebate of $100/month. The rebate is for paying rent on time, maintaining renters insurance, not smoking anywhere on the premises, and not disturbing me or the back tenant. If you are a single person, I offer an additional $45/month discount. Thats because there will be less wear-and-tear and also less trash, so my trash collection bill will be smaller. The current tenant tells me that in her living room and bedroom (which are right under my office), the loudest volume that doesnt disturb me is music played directly from her laptop, at the max level, with no attachable speakers. (Or TV at a comparable volume level.) In her kitchen, using attachable computer speakers doesnt bother me. Thats because its not right under my office. Most of my current and past tenants have qualified for the rebate every single month. In the worst cast, a tenant forfeited the rebate one month out of the whole year. If your rental application is accepted, I will give you contact information for my current and past tenants so you can confirm this. The security deposit is $1,500. Cats OK. Absolutely no dogs. I imagine this apt will rent quickly, even though its not available until August 1st. If you are not able to come see the apartment in person right away, you can either (1) send a Bay area friend to view it for you or (2) ask me to email you a rental application, and apply without seeing it. I will be checking your credit, as well as your landlord and employer references, so please only contact me if all that will check out. I will show the apt at these times: Sun 6/23 at 2pm Mon 6/24 at 6:30pm Each showing only takes 5 minutes, and once a showing is over I will be leaving for other appointments. So if youd like to come, please arrive promptly or a few minutes early. (If you get here early, you can wait in the driveway or the fenced part of the front yard.) 5740 Maccall St, Oakland 94609 (corner of 58th St).

Could this be the one? Will this be the one that stands out? The hardwood entryway was long, as if my apartment came with a private hallway. On the other side? The perfect home! The dark wood cabinets in the kitchen gleamed under the lights. A door located towards the back of the kitchen proudly opened up to a private balcony. A quick trip through the kitchen for a hot cup of coffee, and a step through the patio door to enjoy some fresh air would be the perfect way to start any morning. The living room walls were decorated with large windows framing gorgeous views. As I looked around, I began to picture where my sofa, television, and coffee table would look best in the generous space. Slowly, I made my way to the master bedroom where I was again impressed by the unique style of this apartment home. A small hallway located between two large closets led the way to the master bathroom. I could feel the excitement bubbling as I relished the idea of having so much storage space available to me! With the Fourth Street shopping district so close, it would be a relief to know that I could easily store items from the shopping sprees I intended to spoil myself with.
