There are 2 big mirrored closets in the bedroom which is nice and gives ample storage space. The AC is only in the living room, and there is a new ceiling fan in the dining area as well. Apartment doesnt face any road- so minimal noise.You would only have one neighbor who is a very quiet nice man. Apartment complex is pet friendly (if you have a large dog then you have to rent on the 1st floor though, and I believe there is an additional deposit/pet fee which needs to be paid). Every week they provide complementary tennis lessons, there are several tennis courts and basketball courts on the premises. Nice gym is also available. There is a large swimming pool and BBQ pits next to the pool. It is a huge complex which has several buildings each of which has its own laundry room open 24/7 (card operated). I lived here for 2 months but now I got a job in Foster City so commute and gas expenses are slowly killing me.

If you are interested in my apartment then let me know. I would pay you 500$ which will help out to lower your monthly rent whatever it might be.

The photos show a previous tenants furnishings.) IS THIS THE ONE FOR YOU? A two bedroom + office/ 2 bath home that is inviting and offers a lot of light and space, with a great flow of energy throughout. This charming, light-filled home really does have a special feel. The open floor plan, skylights, many windows and high ceilings all contribute to an aesthetic simplicity and feeling of serenity. This 1600+ sq. ft. home was remodeled completely from the ground up about ten years ago. It had been one of the original homes in the area. It retains a charming country cottage feel even though everything is brand new - plumbing &amp; electrical, kitchen, flooring, furnace, all windows and doors - EVERYTHING was newly installed when remodeled, except for the woodburning stove and hearth that we left in the living room. The exterior is surrounded by greenery, with ample space to garden if desired. There is a newish 10x12 storage shed and half of the old red barn available for covered parking and/or storage. Walk past the covered brick porch through the front door and into a very large living room with high ceiling with skylights and windows providing good light in every room. High ceilings throughout. Each bedroom and the kitchen have sliding glass doors for outside access. The large kitchen (dw/fridge/gas stove) has lots of counter space and cabinets, two skylights, and room for a good sized table. There is a laundry room off the kitchen, as well as another dining (or whatever) area. Right off the living room is a good sized room suitable for an office (no closets so we dont call it a bedroom.) Off the left side of the living room is one bedroom with a large bathroom attached, another equally large bathroom, and a hall leading to the other bedroom. Both bedrooms have high ceilings and good natural light. It really is a special place both inside and out. Great neighborhood and great neighbors, too. About 10 minutes to hwy 101 via 116; and 5 minutes to the heart of downtown Sebastopol. Most of our previous tenants have been single women who were looking for a special place to live. No lease required (month-to-month is fine) but most have stayed 3 years or more before life events took them elsewhere. There is a well and septic, so no water bills need be paid. OK, after all that.... the rent! It is $2,350 per month. Move-in requires first months rent + 1 1/2 months security deposit. If that is in your ballpark, we invite you to come experience the house for yourself and see if it matches your desires. OPEN HOUSE for viewing will be Saturday, June 22, from 1-3pm.

Its most popular attraction is Lombard Street, which is known as the crookedest street in the world due to its seven sharp turns. Similarly, many of the sidewalks are stairways due to the steepness of the streets of this neighborhood. Russian Hill does have a lot of popular restaurants and shops down Hyde Street, and is nearby North Beach, which has even more shops.

One year lease required. Please read this entire ad before contacting me. (That will save us both same back-and-forth over email.) Four photos are below, but you can see more photos here: - 650 square feet (bigger than many 2-bedroom apartments) - Ground floor of a quiet triplex - Sunny windows on three sides - Two closets - Enormous kitchen with granite counters and huge sunny window - Private fenced yard area - Offstreet parking - Easy street parking for your guests Also, the front door opens to the yard. So unlike condos in larger complexes UPS can deliver packages directly to your front door (instead of leaving yellow sticky notes, and making you pick up your packages). There is no laundry in the building, but theres a door-to-door laundry service I use. They pick up your dirty laundry, wash, dry, fold, and return it perfectly folded to your door. Its about $30 for two weeks of laundry (per person). There are also laundrimats nearby. The only utility I pay for is trash pickup. You are responsible for water, gas, electric, phone, cable TV, etc. If you want to, you can chip in for a third of my high speed Internet bill and share my wifi. There is a very large closet in the bedroom, and a small closet in the hallway. GREAT LOCATION: - Halfway btwn the Ashby BART and Rockridge BART stations - 17 blocks from Berkeley Bowl - 7 blocks from the entrance to hwy 24 - Walking distance to the Nomad Cafe - Quiet street with trees, not a through street - The only people who drive here are the neighbors. Most neighboring houses are owner-occupied. That means most of the neighbors are mature and stable people. Its not a transient neighborhood. RECENT RENOVATIONS: - New double pane windows - New pergo flooring (looks like hardwood) - New paint - New fridge - New granite countertop - New stainless steel kitchen sink - New bathroom vanity - New faucets, doorknobs, ceiling lights, etc - The building features new exterior paint, gutters, and landscaping. Im a freelance writer who lives/works right above this apartment. I and the back tenant are both very quiet. However, I sing for 30-45 minutes per day, and you will hear that. I need a quiet environment to concentrate. Ive also promised my back tenant and my roommate that this is a quiet building. So if you have a very quiet lifestyle, Im willing to compensate you for it. The official rent is $1395, but I offer a good tenant rebate of $100/month. The rebate is for paying rent on time, maintaining renters insurance, not smoking anywhere on the premises, and not disturbing me or the back tenant. If you are a single person, I offer an additional $45/month discount. Thats because there will be less wear-and-tear and also less trash, so my trash collection bill will be smaller. The current tenant tells me that in her living room and bedroom (which are right under my office), the loudest volume that doesnt disturb me is music played directly from her laptop, at the max level, with no attachable speakers. (Or TV at a comparable volume level.) In her kitchen, using attachable computer speakers doesnt bother me. Thats because its not right under my office. Most of my current and past tenants have qualified for the rebate every single month. In the worst cast, a tenant forfeited the rebate one month out of the whole year. If your rental application is accepted, I will give you contact information for my current and past tenants so you can confirm this. The security deposit is $1,500. Cats OK. Absolutely no dogs. I imagine this apt will rent quickly, even though its not available until August 1st. If you are not able to come see the apartment in person right away, you can either (1) send a Bay area friend to view it for you or (2) ask me to email you a rental application, and apply without seeing it. I will be checking your credit, as well as your landlord and employer references, so please only contact me if all that will check out. I will show the apt at these times: Wed 6/19 at 6pm Sat 6/22 at 12 noon Sun 6/23 at 2pm Each showing only takes 5 minutes, and once a showing is over I will be leaving for other appointments. So if youd like to come, please arrive promptly or a few minutes early. (If you get here early, you can wait in the driveway or the fenced part of the front yard.) 5740 Maccall St, Oakland 94609 (corner of 58th St).

Though it serves more like a one-bedroom than a studio, it does not have a door enclosing the bedroom off from the remaining living space, so technically it is listed as a studio. However, the layout is such that it provides a remarkable amount of privacy; not that privacy should be much needed if living alone. Although it would work for a couple, this unit is more ideally suited for one individual given the overall size, 700sqft. Water and garbage are included in the rent. One year lease required and $1,000 security deposit due before move-in. *One designated parking spot in gated garage. *Gated condo complex. *Tall ceilings with track lighting. *Radiant heated flooring. *GE energy efficient stainless steel appliances: gas range, bottom freezer refrigerator, dishwasher and microwave (with the appliances and radiant heating, the PG&E; bill will rarely exceed $20 per month. The unit currently averages about $13-15 per month!). *High efficiency washer/dryer in the unit. *Granite counter tops in kitchen and bathroom. *Brazilian cherry hardwood floors in main living area. *Carpet floor in the bedroom/sleeping alcove. *Tile in the bathroom. No A/C but I have never had a need for it. Large school style windows swing open for cross-ventilation. Temperatures are very mild. No balcony or patio area. No pets. No smokers. No storage. Smaller closet (might run into some issues if youre a clothes horse). About the location: Perfect for professional commuting to SF or downtown Oakland. Even better/closer for someone working in the Emeryville business corridor (Pixar/Novartis/Zip/Jamba Juice/Peets/Whole Foods). MacArthur BART is 5 blocks away, a short 8-10 minute walk.

Relax in a spacious living area with floor to ceiling windows (almost an entire wall!) to let in the sun. This wall of widows includes a wide sliding glass door out to a balcony, for your own outdoor space, where you can dine, read, or just enjoy the view. Chill out in front of a fire in the working fireplace. Dine with friends in the adjacent dining area, which has space enough to comfortably fit a table and 6 chairs. Enjoy cooking in a roomy, elegant, well-appointed kitchen, which features granite counters, ample cabinet space &amp; high quality appliances: electric stove, generous fridge, dishwasher &amp; ample cabinet space. The bedroom is big enough to fit a king bed comfortably, with room left over, and has 1 large and 1 smaller closet. There is another large closet, fronted by mirrored doors, in hallway leading to the main living area. The bathroom is almost all white: White tiled shower over tub, white tile floor (with tiny diamonds of black), white sink with white marble vanity, and white w.c. -- just waiting for you to spice up with your own colored towels &amp; accessories. There is a shower door, so you dont even need a shower curtain. The entire apartment, except the bathroom, is floored in light-colored hardwood. The lighting system is exceptional -- halogen lights on dimmer switches for warm, bright lighting that can be lowered to set a romantic mood.

It is centrally located with affordable rents. The blocks closest to Market Street tend to be gritty with a fair share of homeless. However, the rest of the area has some nice pockets, with the best being closest to Nob Hill. Overall, the neighborhood is well located in SF and its popular among art students since you can find decent studios for reasonable prices. Its close to the theaters, Union Square, and there are some tasty ethnic restaurants.
