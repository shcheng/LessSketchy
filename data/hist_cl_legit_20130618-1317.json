This lovely house on a quiet street is coming available because the current tenants are buying a home. The owner has no plans to move into or sell this property, so it could be yours for a long time. Why is this house such a good deal, where tenants tend to stay for numerous years at a time? (the previous tenant lived there 10 years) (a) Its within walking distance of two excellent public schools, Del Rey Elementary, two blocks, and Miramonte High, 1.2 miles. (b) The rent is generally lower than for comparable houses because there is a second unit downstairs, with its own entrance. Its long-term resident is a quiet, retired grandmother whom you will like. She shares the provided laundry machines, and has a space in the two-car garage. There is plenty of parking. Three bedrooms (one quite large) and two baths, all on one level. Large living room with vaulted ceiling and fireplace, dining area, eat-in kitchen with updated appliances. Beautiful views and plenty of sunlight. Large front patio and back deck, usable back yard with lawn and space for a garden. There is an automatic watering system already in place. Lots of storage space. Unfurnished (tenants furniture appears in the photos). The weather tends to be cooler in the summer, warmer in the winter than in Lafayette, Moraga, Walnut Creek, Concord, Pleasant Hill, Alamo, Danville, etc. because of Orindas being first in line for moderating sea breezes.

The ground floor also has a full garage with shop space. It has a fully functional new yet historic kitchen with a $7000 six burner Victorian style stove. There is a beautiful breakfast room adorned by five stained glass windows, bathrooms include a new clawfoot tub, high mount water closet (yes the toilet high on the wall) and modern shower on second floor with victorian tile. There is state-of-the-art underfloor hydronic heat, hardwood floors and fenced backyard and garden shed and patio. The front yard is undergoing a facelift and has a beautiful 1890s wrought iron fence from Pennsylvania around the house with a rose garden soon to come. The house also has a fire sprinkler system and a burglar and fire alarm system. The home is in the final stages of a complete ground up $500,000.00 renovation restoring it to exact historic condition. These photos show the home near completion. All the trim is ornate, door knobs, hinges and plumbing fixtures all have beautiful Victorian detail. There are 8 antique 1890s gas/electric chandeliers (converted to electric) that are amazing. This building is nothing less than spectacular and we would like to find people that would love to live in a mint condition historic landmark! The building is being painted and landscaped now. This is possibly the most historically accurate and well preserved original home in Berkeley. It is one of Berkeleys oldest homes and has been declared a Historic Landmark. Were looking for a couple, a family or an individual, not a bunch of roommates. Its centrally located between Shattuck and Telegraph with easy access to UCB and downtown Berkeley as well as easy access to I-80 and San Francisco.

For being 109 years old I am surprised this 20 unit building hasnt been demolished yet because it violates many of todays standard safety building codes. Also, there is no management here once so ever. This means loud noise 24/7. Theres nobody to shutdown the party happening 4 in the morning or anybody to repair leaking pipes when needed. Repairs here take months, if at all. California law requires that rental unit buildings of 16 units or more must have a on-site resident manager in the employ of the owner or property management company living on the premises.

This is an older apartment with lots of character. One flight of stairs lead up to a huge kitchen, living room/study and bedroom in an open plan arrangement. The kitchen has tiled countertops, large fridge, gas stove and oven, microwave, loads of storage space, and is wonderfully bright, overlooking the Berkeley hills. The living room/study is spacious yet cozy, with lots of south-facing windows, 2 desks, bookshelves, gas heater. The bedroom has a queen-sized bed, chest of drawers and wardrobe, lets onto the bathroom and shower. Extremely quiet leafy street. Mostly families. Lovely neighbors. Youll sleep well here. But close to everything. Walking distance to Whole Foods, Safeway, Trader Joe, Berkeley Bowl, Elmwood and Rockridge shops and restaurants. Cycle to UC Berkeley in 12 minutes, to Ashby or Rockridge BART stations in less than 15 minutes, access bus routes on Telegraph or College in 5 minutes, City Carshare location 3 minute walk away. Owning a car works too, great parking, less than five minutes to 24. Two cats currently live here (theyre moving with me), so, not the best place for cat allergies.

The house has views of the Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge from several areas (living room, master bedroom, deck and yard), and French doors that open from the kitchen area onto a large back deck with a very large wild-ish backyard meadow (the house is on 1/3 acre.) The yard has a big vegetable garden, a mature oak tree with a swing, and a pear tree. The main part of the house has a very open floor plan (kitchen, living room dining room are all one large room) with wooden floors, and the bedrooms are carpeted. The master bedroom has views of the bay. Bonus-there is a free-standing carpeted office with windows in the backyard. The house is 3 blocks from a large park, 2 blocks from open hiking area, 4 blocks from a public saline swimming pool and community center, 4 blocks from a cafe and small commercial area, and 10 blocks from the El Cerrito Natural Grocery. The house will be partially furnished for the year-we are somewhat flexible about what furniture stays. We want to find someone who will appreciate and enjoy it and treat it very well- responsible tenants with references are a must. If you are outdoorsy, you will LOVE the huge deck and enormous backyard, or if you are an avid gardener, you will appreciate the tremendous amount of garden space. It is a gem of a place. We will possibly want you to agree to keep our sweet and gentle indoor-outdoor tabby cat for the year. We also have 2 laying hens who like to free-range, but we can easily find them a place to go if need be. The rent is $2600 per month, and you are responsible for minor repairs-we have a very nice but hands-off landlord.

One year lease required. Please read this entire ad before contacting me. (That will save us both same back-and-forth over email.) Four photos are below, but you can see more photos here: - 650 square feet (bigger than many 2-bedroom apartments) - Ground floor of a quiet triplex - Sunny windows on three sides - Two closets - Enormous kitchen with granite counters and huge sunny window - Private fenced yard area - Offstreet parking - Easy street parking for your guests Also, the front door opens to the yard. So unlike condos in larger complexes UPS can deliver packages directly to your front door (instead of leaving yellow sticky notes, and making you pick up your packages). There is no laundry in the building, but theres a door-to-door laundry service I use. They pick up your dirty laundry, wash, dry, fold, and return it perfectly folded to your door. Its about $30 for two weeks of laundry (per person). There are also laundrimats nearby. The only utility I pay for is trash pickup. You are responsible for water, gas, electric, phone, cable TV, etc. If you want to, you can chip in for a third of my high speed Internet bill and share my wifi. There is a very large closet in the bedroom, and a small closet in the hallway. GREAT LOCATION: - Halfway btwn the Ashby BART and Rockridge BART stations - 17 blocks from Berkeley Bowl - 7 blocks from the entrance to hwy 24 - Walking distance to the Nomad Cafe - Quiet street with trees, not a through street - The only people who drive here are the neighbors. Most neighboring houses are owner-occupied. That means most of the neighbors are mature and stable people. Its not a transient neighborhood. RECENT RENOVATIONS: - New double pane windows - New pergo flooring (looks like hardwood) - New paint - New fridge - New granite countertop - New stainless steel kitchen sink - New bathroom vanity - New faucets, doorknobs, ceiling lights, etc - The building features new exterior paint, gutters, and landscaping. Im a freelance writer who lives/works right above this apartment. I and the back tenant are both very quiet. However, I sing for 30-45 minutes per day, and you will hear that. I need a quiet environment to concentrate. Ive also promised my back tenant and my roommate that this is a quiet building. So if you have a very quiet lifestyle, Im willing to compensate you for it. The official rent is $1395, but I offer a good tenant rebate of $100/month. The rebate is for paying rent on time, maintaining renters insurance, not smoking anywhere on the premises, and not disturbing me or the back tenant. If you are a single person, I offer an additional $45/month discount. Thats because there will be less wear-and-tear and also less trash, so my trash collection bill will be smaller. The current tenant tells me that in her living room and bedroom (which are right under my office), the loudest volume that doesnt disturb me is music played directly from her laptop, at the max level, with no attachable speakers. (Or TV at a comparable volume level.) In her kitchen, using attachable computer speakers doesnt bother me. Thats because its not right under my office. Most of my current and past tenants have qualified for the rebate every single month. In the worst cast, a tenant forfeited the rebate one month out of the whole year. If your rental application is accepted, I will give you contact information for my current and past tenants so you can confirm this. The security deposit is $1,500. Cats OK. Absolutely no dogs. I imagine this apt will rent quickly, even though its not available until August 1st. If you are not able to come see the apartment in person right away, you can either (1) send a Bay area friend to view it for you or (2) ask me to email you a rental application, and apply without seeing it. I will be checking your credit, as well as your landlord and employer references, so please only contact me if all that will check out. I will show the apt at these times: Tues 6/18 at 7pm Wed 6/19 at 6pm Each showing only takes 5 minutes, and once a showing is over I will be leaving for other appointments. So if youd like to come, please arrive promptly or a few minutes early. (If you get here early, you can wait in the driveway or the fenced part of the front yard.) 5740 Maccall St, Oakland 94609 (corner of 58th St).

Do you want country-style living, within walking distance to downtown Los Altos? If your income is a minimum of $19,000-$20,000 per month gross and you have good credit, we are looking for a Joint Venture (J/V) partner to qualify for a new loan at $900,000 to a $1,000,000 range. The down payment will be provided by me. We have two homes in Los Altos Hills. The properties are currently valued in the $2.5-$3.0 million range each. They are next to each other and sit on over 5.6 acres. As part of the J/V, we are willing to put an additional $50,000 to $100,000 into the homes to update them. The maximum monthly payment the J/V partner would make would be the equivalent of below-market rents ($4,000 for the smaller home, $6,500 for the larger home). The J/V partner would enjoy all the tax benefits up to the equivalent rent. That would be $48,000 in tax deductions for the smaller home per year and $78,000 for the larger home. Your effective rent after your tax deductions will be much lower (depending on your tax bracket). The partnership would be for a minimum of five years. If you need to move in less than five years, the loan would still stay in place, but we would be able to re-rent the home to cover the monthly payments. If interested in discussing further, please email me. * Effective rate assumes a 50% state and federal tax bracket.

Its most popular attraction is Lombard Street, which is known as the crookedest street in the world due to its seven sharp turns. Similarly, many of the sidewalks are stairways due to the steepness of the streets of this neighborhood. Russian Hill does have a lot of popular restaurants and shops down Hyde Street, and is nearby North Beach, which has even more shops. With significantly less crime than other areas of San Francisco, Russian Hill is a great place to live.

Overall, the neighborhood is well located in SF and its popular among art students since you can find decent studios for reasonable prices. Its close to the theaters, Union Square, and there are some tasty ethnic restaurants.

I have my 30-foot travel trailer available for rent. I have lived in it for a year with my girlfriend and it was an AWESOME experience. Everything you need is just a few steps away. It is very true about having less things will have you worry less. So simple, but its true! I highly recommend trying it. Features include: - 29 foot coach with one large slide/pop out (Make: Jayco, Model: Jayflight 29QBH). - Bedroom 1 has queen-size bed - Bedroom 2 has 4 bunkbeds. I used the top bunks for extra clothing shelves. - Dining table seats 4 - Living room area has pullout couch and entertainment console that can hold 26 flat screen TV. It also has a stereo with speakers inside and outside the RV. - Full kitchen with 3-burner (gas) stove, oven, microwave, refrigerator with freezer - Full bathroom with shower, sink, and toilet - Centralized Heater/Air-conditioning with auto temp control - Large awning outside to hangout outside as you barbecue or enjoy the outdoors - Cost of gas/electricity very low. I spent as low as $10/month. Video walkthru of the trailer: The RV will be available starting July 1st. Cost to rent as low as $450/month* for trailer only. Tenant is responsible for RV park fees. Trailer can be parked in any place within the Bay Area upon approval. I can tow it and park it to the RV park. Towing the RV will not be allowed by the tenant. Background check required. 3, 6, 12-Month leasing contract available. 12-month term = $500/month 6-month term = $600/month 3-month term = $700/month *10% Discount if rental fee paid in full for lease term. If camper living sound like something for you, contact me. Id be happy to answer any questions. To get an idea on how much rv park fees are, google RV Park in the area you want to live. Most sites have the rates on their website. They range from $500-$1000 per month. I stayed at Trailer Villa in Redwood City. Since they are on the peninsula and I lived in the newer area of the park, the monthly rate is at the higher end. It is currently stored at an RV Storage in Gilroy. If you would like to schedule a tour, we will need to meet at the storage facility. "}, {"hasPost": 0.0, "head": "530 41st.

The location is absolutely wonderful: 2 blocks to shopping and dining on Polk Street 10 minute walk to North Beach (Little Italy) 25 minute walk from downtown/Union Square (or 15 minutes on bus/cable car) 30 minute walk to Ferry Building Marketplace - home of the best Farmers Market in the country! The apartment does face the street, and the cable car runs down it, so there is some city noise. The neighborhood is very hilly so bring comfy shoes. :) Parking is not the best in this neighborhood, but you definitely dont need a car in SF (and you can get a pass at a nearby lot if needed).

You might be able to take it a few days earlier says my current tenant. Partially furnished SMALL studio condo on 25th street near Dolores and Church streets in Noe Valley. Closest neighborhoods: Mission, Castro, Glen Park, Diamond Heights. $1600 includes everything but cable/phone. Month to month lease, however I can agree to commit to 6 months if the first month works out well and my plans to be mobile and house sit around town stay the same. I am a local owner in the field of education, currently floating around and finding my ideal living and working situation in the bay area. I would like to find a nice, relatively quiet person to rent the place. Ive had a great experience with all my renters. Sorry no subletters allowed. You must give 30 days notice of move out (and you will get 30 days notice from me). Best candidates will enjoy Noe Valley living - quiet, fairly crime free, tree-lined and hilly streets with great views, lots of sun and easy access to 24th street shopping (5 minute walk). Parking is usually available on the street outside the place. The place is 1/2 block from the J-church line to the city center (2 minute walk) and BART (10 minute walk). Since I own only part of the building, you must be courteous and respectful of the 3 other building owners with whom you share common space and a very nice big lush backyard (with gas grill). You must be aware of and abide by the Housing Association policies. You should be a mature and stable person (financially and otherwise). Not too much storage space outside is available. It is like puling teeth to get the other ladies to allow a bike in the backyard...if they like you, they may agree to it. Emphasis is on Neat and Quiet to fit into the building. Condo is in an beautiful old, well taken care of, refurbished house with spacious backyard. Built 1899 and with classy colorful SF style. I own a basement studio that has plenty of windows and light. I have a separate entrance (only about 4 stairs down) with easy access to backyard (with deck, BBQ and chairs/table). No staircases to climb! Only 3 women share the entire property with me (3 stories, 4 units) two of the four are owner occupied. The ladies take good care of the place...one lady in particular is always around and will leave little love notes for you if you leave things out and about or dont properly separate your garbage - what fun! Generally you can sit alone in the quiet, well maintained backyard on a sunny day and pretend you are by the Mediterranean ;-D Details: -couch may be available in the place (3 person, dark blue, nice) -Free laundry in building. -Utilities (gas, electric), water, trash, compost, recycling and internet are included in rent. Phone line/cable TV is not included. -Has a small (but not mini) fridge, 2 burner electric stove and a convection/microwave oven.

It is very true about having less things will have you worry less. So simple, but its true! I highly recommend trying it. Features include: - 29 foot coach with one large slide/pop out (Make: Jayco, Model: Jayflight 29QBH). - Bedroom 1 has queen-size bed - Bedroom 2 has 4 bunkbeds. I used the top bunks for extra clothing shelves. - Dining table seats 4 - Living room area has pullout couch and entertainment console that can hold 26 flat screen TV. It also has a stereo with speakers inside and outside the RV. - Full kitchen with 3-burner (gas) stove, oven, microwave, refrigerator with freezer - Full bathroom with shower, sink, and toilet - Centralized Heater/Air-conditioning with auto temp control - Large awning outside to hangout outside as you barbecue or enjoy the outdoors - Cost of gas/electricity very low. I spent as low as $10/month. Video walkthru of the trailer: The RV will be available starting July 1st. Cost to rent as low as $450/month* for trailer only. Tenant is responsible for RV park fees. Trailer can be parked in any place within the Bay Area upon approval. I can tow it and park it to the RV park. Towing the RV will not be allowed by the tenant. Background check required. 3, 6, 12-Month leasing contract available. 12-month term = $500/month 6-month term = $600/month 3-month term = $700/month *10% Discount if rental fee paid in full for lease term. If camper living sound like something for you, contact me. Id be happy to answer any questions. To get an idea on how much rv park fees are, google RV Park in the area you want to live. Most sites have the rates on their website. They range from $500-$1000 per month. I stayed at Trailer Villa in Redwood City. Since they are on the peninsula and I lived in the newer area of the park, the monthly rate is at the higher end. It is currently stored at an RV Storage in Gilroy.
