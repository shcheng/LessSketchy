The apartment does face the street, and the cable car runs down it, so there is some city noise. The neighborhood is very hilly so bring comfy shoes. :) Parking is not the best in this neighborhood, but you definitely dont need a car in SF (and you can get a pass at a nearby lot if needed).

(b) The rent is generally lower than for comparable houses because there is a second unit downstairs, with its own entrance. Its long-term resident is a quiet, retired grandmother whom you will like. She shares the provided laundry machines, and has a space in the two-car garage. There is plenty of parking. Three bedrooms (one quite large) and two baths, all on one level.

Large front patio and back deck, usable back yard with lawn and space for a garden. There is an automatic watering system already in place. Lots of storage space.

You might be able to take it a few days earlier says my current tenant. Partially furnished SMALL studio condo on 25th street near Dolores and Church streets in Noe Valley. Closest neighborhoods: Mission, Castro, Glen Park, Diamond Heights. $1600 includes everything but cable/phone. Month to month lease, however I can agree to commit to 6 months if the first month works out well and my plans to be mobile and house sit around town stay the same. I am a local owner in the field of education, currently floating around and finding my ideal living and working situation in the bay area. I would like to find a nice, relatively quiet person to rent the place. Ive had a great experience with all my renters. Sorry no subletters allowed. You must give 30 days notice of move out (and you will get 30 days notice from me). Best candidates will enjoy Noe Valley living - quiet, fairly crime free, tree-lined and hilly streets with great views, lots of sun and easy access to 24th street shopping (5 minute walk). Parking is usually available on the street outside the place. The place is 1/2 block from the J-church line to the city center (2 minute walk) and BART (10 minute walk). Since I own only part of the building, you must be courteous and respectful of the 3 other building owners with whom you share common space and a very nice big lush backyard (with gas grill). You must be aware of and abide by the Housing Association policies. You should be a mature and stable person (financially and otherwise). Not too much storage space outside is available. It is like puling teeth to get the other ladies to allow a bike in the backyard...if they like you, they may agree to it. Emphasis is on Neat and Quiet to fit into the building. Condo is in an beautiful old, well taken care of, refurbished house with spacious backyard. Built 1899 and with classy colorful SF style. I own a basement studio that has plenty of windows and light. I have a separate entrance (only about 4 stairs down) with easy access to backyard (with deck, BBQ and chairs/table). No staircases to climb! Only 3 women share the entire property with me (3 stories, 4 units) two of the four are owner occupied. The ladies take good care of the place...one lady in particular is always around and will leave little love notes for you if you leave things out and about or dont properly separate your garbage - what fun! Generally you can sit alone in the quiet, well maintained backyard on a sunny day and pretend you are by the Mediterranean ;-D Details: -couch may be available in the place (3 person, dark blue, nice) -Free laundry in building. -Utilities (gas, electric), water, trash, compost, recycling and internet are included in rent. Phone line/cable TV is not included. -Has a small (but not mini) fridge, 2 burner electric stove and a convection/microwave oven. Kitchen and bath are pretty colorful and the kitchen in particular is nice/modern looking. No Smokers, no pets, no drum sets (;0). You must be quiet, respectful and clean. Sorry, one person only. Guests that stay more than a five days must be cleared by me. Deposit required: $1600 (with agreement) + rent for one month ($1600 + $1600 = $3200) required to get the place. A professional (green) cleaning fee will be taken at the end of your stay from the deposit ($100.00). This fee is negotiable in the case that you are planning to scrub it down, mop and clean the windows on your own. If you are interested, please send me the blurb about yourself. I am sorry - I cannot respond to everyone that emails me. Please understand! I will get back to you about scheduling. Id like to show it Monday (today) at 5pm-6pm and Tuesday at 5pm-6pm Let me know what works for you and ill respond with the address.

The house is divided into 2 homes like a duplex, but with more privacy than a regular duplex (the 3 bedrooms, for instance, dont share any walls, floors or ceilings with the other unit). It is currently me (the landlord) that lives in the other 1-bedroom unit in the house. The downstairs consists of one very large open living room/dining room with a brand new kitchen area in the back, and a half-bath. There is also a sweet little deck off of this room. There is a very large unfinished garage with your own washer &amp; dryer. There is enough room in there for one car and plenty of storage. Upstairs has the 3 bedrooms (one is 12x13, one about 12x10, and the other 12x9) and the bathroom with roomy 2-person shower. Oak hardwood floors and wood beamed ceilings throughout the upstairs, brand new carpeting and tile downstairs. Kitchen is not finished in the photos yet. There is a very large sloped shared yard on a hillside with lots of potential. A part of it is currently enclosed as a dog run. Great views of hills, nice neighbors, super-easy access to major freeways. There is some freeway noise that can be heard, but barely any through-traffic sounds since the home is on a cul-de-sac. Ideally looking for a July 1 move-in day since home is available now, but move in date is flexible for the right people. Rent is $2,675 per month, including garbage and water. 6-month lease to start, with a one-month deposit. After that, if everyone is happy with the situation, I will be glad to renew the lease or go month-to-month. There will not be a general open house; rather, I will set up individual appointments with people, so please include your name and phone number in your reply if you are interested. I will be out of town from june 17-24 with no email, but will reply when I return. Thanks!

No privacy, always getting yelled at for one thing or another. So, what we want to do is look for a couple or few roomates that we can rent a house with the Brentwood/ Oakley/ Bethel Island/ Byron/ Knightsen areas. we would all evenly distribute the Rent, For Example : Rent is $1000 theres 4 people in the house thats $250 each person....see where im going with this!? CHEAP. and of course the bills will also be evenly distributed through out everyone. Our Ideal Roomate would be as follows: NOT allergic to dogs (we have a dog) Likes animals. non- smoker, chewing tobacco is okay Someone with a stable job that can pick up their portion of the bills/ rent when they are due. Not a complete Slob lol and decent hygiene lol NO pedos, rapists, or druggies lol WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE A HOUSE.thats why we are looking for people to rent with. we want to find a house that will fit everyones budget.. lets make this happen in the next couple months!

Tastefully remodeled less than a year ago, this apartment has a stunning gourmet kitchen with granite countertops, two separate Thermador (yes, thats right) ovens, a six-burner range, a Thermador refrigerator, soft-closing cabinet drawers, and a large-cut polished travertine floor. The three bedrooms are located at the back of the apartment overlooking the garden. The third bedroom is large enough for a queen or a full, but has doors connecting it to the other two rooms (perfect for a small family or a home office, less perfect for three separate roommates). The bathroom is split with a built-in stone bench and separate WC. Washing machine and dryer at the garden level. The back yard has beautiful roses, a white magnolia tree, lilac, wisteria, etc. For anyone who wants to get their hands dirty, theres loads of space and no one standing in your way. The rest of the apartment retains its original charm with stained glass pendant lights, built-ins, and a working fireplace! Its a special spot and really needs to be seen to be appreciated. Parking is included along with a large garden level storage room that could be converted into a studio space. Available July 1st.

This stunning two-storey, three-bedroom, one-bath town-home has had a near complete renovation - carpeting, wood -flooring, cabinets, appliances, bathroom fixtures, locks, paint - and even the door-bell. Almost nothing has been left out with tiled floors and new appliances, and all done in matching decorator tones. The design is the best in the development. The home was originally renovated for sale, but then the real estate market went South. This home faces the Hillcrest Park park itself, and is 100 from Federal Terrace School. An outstanding unit in an ideal location! This unit has the nicest garden in the development and a shed for extra storage, three levels of patio, all covered with a specially designed gazebo. Privacy is assured by the 6 high fence and the French iron screen - specially made for the purpose once again. One parking place adjacent to the unit is available under cover with unlimited street parking just outside your home. There are no neighbours above or below only next to you behind insulated walls. A laundry is built-in - very unusual for the development. Located very close to a major shopping centre, the unit provides easy-living as well as access to all freeways. At 1051 square feet the homes combines space, convenience and value in a well-kept condo development which includes a recreation area and parks. Sewer and water are paid for by the owner. Sewer connection normally costs $45 monthly in Vallejo, while the water costs about $80 depending on use - you save at least $124 a month. With the lovely interior, private garden, closeness to schools and freeways, and bargain price, this home is perfect for any type of family or living arrangement. The owner welcomes those of us who have had the misfortune to be obliged to move as a result of foreclosure and those of us lucky enough to be on Section 8.

The open, flowing floor plan is ideal for entertaining or simply retreating to the family room to enjoy the sweet garden outlook. Some of the many specialized features of this home include a gourment kitchen, nine and a half foot ceilings, custom bookshelves, and both gas and wood-burning fireplaces. The Master Bedroom has sweeping views, as well as a generous double closet and Master Bath. The striking hallway with illuminated, built-in glass shelves leads to the two large rear bedrooms, each of them stepping out to a charming rear patio. The property is semi-detached offering abundant natural light throughout, especially in the living room with its new gas fireplace. The front of the living room extends out far beyond neighboring homes, allowing panoramic views from both the front and sides of the living room that take in downtown SF and Eureka Valley on the left, Liberty Hill and beautiful Victorians across the street, and Noe Valley and the Bay to the right. The formal dining room and living room are grand in scale and design and connect seamlessly, making this home perfect for entertaining. Gorgeous deep brown walnut hardwood floors were recently installed in the living room, dining room, family room, master bedroom, and hallway, instilling a sense of grandeur and elegance throughout. The gourmet kitchen was remodeled in 2009 and features gorgeous granite countertops, maple cabinets, hi-end Thermador refrigerator and appliances, and an attractive new tiled floor, and opens to the rear family room. The family room, with a 60-inch Pioneer big screen TV and balcony, overlooks a serene flowering garden and is ideal for contemporary urban living. An attractive wine bar was added in 2010. The master bedroom has sweeping views of Downtown, Eureka Valley, and the neighboring Victorian Ladies. There is also generous closet space and a tiled master bath with separate tub and stall shower. The two rear bedrooms are nicely separated from the Master by a long, elegant hallway, with built-in illuminated glass shelves.

Available July 1. This cottage is a converted detached free-standing garage -- made into one large room with a kitchenette on one side, a full bath (shower over tub), and a small separate room with its own entrance -- suitable for a bedroom or office. (My current tenant uses it as a small, cozy bedroom, but I myself used it as a therapy office. Ideal for a healer or bodyworker who wants to see clients in a home office!) The whole place is colorful, sunny, and has an artsy and spiritual feel to it -- handmade Mexican tiles, a tile mosaic on an outside wall, a big Buddha welcoming you as you walk down the driveway, etc. My tenant just let me know she needs to leave due to health problems, so I dont have photos ready of the interior of the cottage -- but these photos show it from the outside. Im out of town now, but if I dont rent it tomorrow I will take some interior photos and post them! The cottage shares a large \u017a acre bay view lot with a house containing 3 separate apartments -- all rented to quiet, respectful people. The cottage is completely separate and apart from the other units, but shares use of the hot tub, laundry facilities, and gardens. Tenants sometimes cooperate with one another on gardening projects, occasional pet-sitting, etc., but there are no expectations and youre welcome to be completely independent OR to try to build a sense of community, whichever works for you! Current residents of the property include an MFT intern, a Buddhist meditation teacher, a tech recruiter on a spiritual path, and a dog-walker. Age range is 20s-60s. There are also three indoor-outdoor cats and an aging Golden Retriever on the property, so any other animals would have to be able to integrate into the mix. I am open to another well-behaved cat or two (as long as it/they are not bullies to the cats already on the property), or to an extremely well-behaved, mellow, NON-BARKING dog. Other features of the cottage include: - A huge window looking out at the back yard and, beyond it, the bay. Faces southwest, so its very bright and sunny. - Separate small office/bedroom (approx 7 ft by 9 ft) also has a southwest window with the same great view, plus a cathedral ceiling and a ceiling fan. - Large closet in main room (approx. 15 feet wide.) No closet in small room. - Brick patio with bay view, plus (shared) hot tub right outside your door! - Shared washer and dryer. - LOTS of garden space. Onsite (young) orchard with 15+ fruit trees! Also big perennial tree collards, various herbs, lots of flowers. Preference given to tenant(s) who would like to add their energy to the garden! - Kitchenette currently contains a small fridge, hotplate and electric kettle (along with a counter and sink). I am open to adding an apartment-sized stove and/or fridge if desired. - Heating has been via electric space heater, but I will be installing a gas wall heater in the next few months. - Wifi and all utilities included for additional $100/month (so total rent + utilities = $1300.) - Can be rented unfurnished, or I can provide some furnishings if desired. - This location is quiet and safe, but inconvenient if you dont have a car. There is bus service, but its not great, and its too hilly to bike from here unless youre in superb shape. Convenient freeway access, but no stores or cafes to walk to. - Driveway parking may be available (negotiable). If not, there is always plenty of street parking. - 10-minute walk to back gate of Mills College. Month-to-month lease. $3600 move-in cost (1st, last, deposit); may be negotiable for the right tenant. Seeking one or two tenants who is/are quiet, non-smoking, non-drug-using, communicative, mature and sane. Preference given to people who will garden, and/or people who are in some way engaged in making the world a better place. Se habla espanol. Queer-friendly a must. Interested? Please read below, then send an email describing something about who you are, and why you feel this place would be a good fit for you. (Please dont give me just your name and phone number; do write something about yourself! I usually get tons of responses and will not respond to you unless you indicate how and why youd be a good fit for this funky, artsy, peaceful oasis in the hills.) I can show the place between 8 and 9 pm Sunday night, before 11 Monday morning, or after 8:30 Monday night, for starters. . . blessings, Ruth inlaw in-law "}, {"hasPost": 1.0, "head": "Large Sunnyvale Home in Desirable Neighborhood", "lon": -122.0349, "price": 4950.0, "pid": 3873994960.0, "phone": -1, "link": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/apa/3873994960.html", "nbr": 4.0, "lat": 37.3502, "post": " Large Sunnyvale Home in Most Desirable Neighborhood (Los Altos Border, Cupertino School District) ***OPEN HOUSE for interested renters scheduled on Saturday, June 22 from 10am-noon*** 4 Bedrooms/2.5 Baths (2331 sq. ft. -- single story) 1 large Master bedroom suite with vaulted ceiling, walk-in closet, and bathroom featuring step-down shower and double sinks 3 additional large bedrooms Living room with vaulted ceiling Dining room Family room with built-in bookshelves Kitchen with breakfast nook (double ovens, BOSCH dishwasher, pantry) Laundry room Ample storage throughout home (numerous closets and cabinets) Hardwood parquet floors and carpet throughout New vinyl windows New water heater Mature citrus trees and beautiful flowering plants throughout landscaping Situated in the heart of Silicon Valley, bordering on cities of Los Altos, Cupertino and Mountain View Easy access to major Highways 85/101/237/280 and Foothill Expressway Schools: West Valley Elementary, Cupertino Middle, Homestead High (walking distance to all) No smoking or pets House does not have fridge, washer or dryer.

Though it serves more like a one-bedroom than a studio, it does not have a door enclosing the bedroom off from the remaining living space, so technically it is listed as a studio. However, the layout is such that it provides a remarkable amount of privacy; not that privacy should be much needed if living alone. Although it would work for a couple, this unit is more ideally suited for one individual given the overall size, 700sqft. Water and garbage are included in the rent. One year lease required and $1,000 security deposit due before move-in. *One designated parking spot in gated garage. *Gated condo complex. *Tall ceilings with track lighting. *Radiant heated flooring. *GE energy efficient stainless steel appliances: gas range, bottom freezer refrigerator, dishwasher and microwave (with the appliances and radiant heating, the PG&E; bill will rarely exceed $20 per month. The unit currently averages about $13-15 per month!). *High efficiency washer/dryer in the unit. *Granite counter tops in kitchen and bathroom. *Brazilian cherry hardwood floors in main living area. *Carpet floor in the bedroom/sleeping alcove. *Tile in the bathroom. No A/C but I have never had a need for it. Large school style windows swing open for cross-ventilation. Temperatures are very mild. No balcony or patio area. No pets. No smokers. No storage.

It has a sunny kitchen, a living room/dining room, two bedrooms, a bathroom with shower over the tub, and a large completely glassed in porch, with windows that wrap around the front of the house, that makes a very inviting second living room at one end and space for a pleasant light filled work area at the other end. After viewing the photos below, please call for an appointment to see the house in person today. The lot is nearly a third of an acre and its privacy and spacious country feel is enhanced by the fact that the lots on either side are not allowed to be built on, so the neighbors pay the taxes and we all enjoy the benefits of more open space on both sides. There is a glimpse of the Petaluma River from the front of the house and the back of the property borders on a lovely green fairway of the Stone Tree Golf Club. The homes hidden in the trees on the hills across that broad fairway are all worth well over a million dollars. Our immediate neighborhood on Manzanita Avenue is filled with a mix of both younger couples, single and older folks, who are very pleasant. It is a wonderfully relaxed and peaceful neighborhood that the residents all love. Manzanita Avenue is a country lane, which fortunately ends only about 5 or 6 houses beyond our home, so there is virtually no vehicle traffic to worry about. You get to live in the country and yet you are only about 6 minutes drive from Highway 101 and perhaps another 6 or 7 minutes drive to Whole Foods and Trader Joes and all the other businesses and banking and supermarkets and Charming Old Town Novato shops and many restaurants of every variety. The Vintage Oaks Shopping center is even closer with a multiplex movie theater, Starbucks and Macys furniture, Ross, Pier One imports and many restaurants and of course Marin Countys only Costco. Although Black Point feels like a welcome retreat from more crowded living, it is actually close enough to the central 101 corridor that it has easy access to San Rafael, Corte Madera, Mill Valley, San Anselmo and even San Francisco. Well over $100,000 has been spent in the last few months on upgrading the home with a long list of things such as a new premium roof, the amount of insulation has probably doubled, an entirely new and exceptionally solid concrete foundation and sub structure beams were installed. There is now all new plumbing and new electrical wiring. The kitchen was lovingly restored to classic period style with new tile countertops, new shaker cabinets, with oil rubbed bronze knobs and accessories, including a new Victorian faucet, a new dishwasher, a new built in microwave, new wood look flooring and new lighting. The bathroom too was remodeled with new tub and vintage type faucets and pedestal sink and toilet and classic black and white mosaic floor tile. New hardwood hickory flooring was installed in the beautiful light-filled porch, surrounded by the classic cottage windows that look out onto the garden and trees that surround the house. Three new windows and three new doors and hardware were installed There is a cast iron natural gas fireplace that turns on and off with the push of a button on the remote or it can be set to turn on or off at any temperature. A new deer resistant flower garden with an automatic drip irrigation system was installed just outside the glassed front porch. Because of the newly refurbished condition of the house, no pets please. There is a small single car type garage structure that has been used in the past mostly as a rustic workshop plus the basement has washer and dryer hookups and lots of space for storage or other uses. There is also a redwood deck off the kitchen and another lower deck in front of the covered BBQ area where a previous tenant used to have a hot tub. The house and grounds is now is the perfect location for a romantic country retreat. The house is finally ready to be shown for the first time in its refurbished condition, so if you are interested to see it before it gets snapped up, please call the owner at 805-637-0774 or email today to make an appointment to come see it today or tomorrow morning in person to see if it is the right place for you.
