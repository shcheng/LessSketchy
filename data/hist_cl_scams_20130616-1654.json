Keep posting them! They think they own CL and can control what people say. That is the mentality of SC landLORDS. Ive lived in Santa Cruz for over 4 decades. Santa Cruz landlords (majority are slumlords) are very controlling, demanding, and nosey. All they want is money and they put a ton of restrictions on the renter-except for the overcrowded house of students that they allow to torment long time resident neighbors. They never fix anything and offer sub-standard living conditions. If you are thinking about moving here- dont!!!! I cant wait to get out of this place! Its not worth it. And really, Santa Cruz isnt all that-totally overrated! Seriously, what is so great about SC that would make it worth being treat badly by landlords, overpaying for substandard living and not being able to keep your family members? Keep your pets (as you should-its a life long commitment) and move to somewhere that is affordable, nice and friendly. Santa Cruz sucks! Flag their posts since they want to stiffle us!
