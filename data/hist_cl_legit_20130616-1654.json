If you feel the need to be active, try the XBOX. If you insist on leaving the great indoors, try a drink on the roof deck at sunset to start with. If you get hungry, North Beach is just half a block. And if you insist on going into work, the financial district is a nice 10 minute walk. We didnt just make the place comfy either. We made it greener. Most lights are low power LEDs, the appliances are all energy-star rated, and the hot water heater is a high efficiency, continuous flow heater that combines energy efficiency with a literally unlimited capacity. The only limit on your time in the shower will be your conscience. One parking spot for a compact car and available on a first-come, first-served basis. NO smoking and NO pets!

The front of the house is also ideal for residents to use as it sits on a cul-de-sac, making it safe for activities. Mira Vista Hills Park is less than a block away.

The place is fully furnished with ecclectic, artistic, clean furniture. I am looking preferably for a longer-term subletter for the months to come. I will consider both longer-term and shorter-term sublets. Heres the link to my Air B&B; site which has some pictures (more to come) and a short description of the place: House is located 2.5 blocks from MacArthur BART in Oakland, and is also near the C and F Trans-Bay AC transit lines, as well as numerous local bus lines (including the Emery-Go-Round that takes you right to Emeryville shopping). On-site laundry, off-street parking in the driveway. The house is on Lusk St. between 40th and 41st Streets. Very large, sunny, and open kitchen has all the usual features plus a dishwasher. The living room is large and open as well, with newly finished hardwood floors, loads of morning sunshine, and decorated with artsy (but clean!) furnishings (paintings on the walls by owner and friends). No television here! The bedroom is the uniquely built-out attic space which has a footprint bigger than 30 x 30! Large dormer window overlooks Oakland and Emeryville and beyond that theres a view from the bed of Mt. Tam and if you look in just the right direction you can see the Golden Gate too! This is a very open and somewhat eclectic space (rafters are bare, wood floors are unfinished) that has a lot of room for all sorts of activities ranging from reading, relaxing, yoga, dance, work, play, or wonderful deep sleeping! Note: stairs to the attic are steep and so arent appropriate for people who have issues with walking or balance. They are nothing outrageous and extremely manageable for most everyone with average abilities. The attic is uninsulated and therefore on the warmer side in the summer afternoons. Large windows let in wonderful afternoon sunshine and cross-breezes and I routinely open them in the morning and close them at night. Its also cooler in winter nights. Thats the trade-off. Full kitchen complete with modern toaster, electric kettle, full gas range and oven, etc. Full bath and shower, washer and drier on site, outside driveway parking for one or two cars may be arranged if requested (otherwise ample street parking always available). Piano for careful use (a mid-range Yamaha-- hammer-action digital Clavinova with volume control and full pedals). Access to a large backyard that is shared with the back-unit residents. Rent is pro-rated for your visit based on an $1800/month rate with utilities included (power, water, waste, and DSL). A security deposit will be required and returned after you leave and all is well ($1000). Email me if you are interested and LEAVE A PHONE NUMBER. I will return calls but NOT emails. Seriously. I want to be able to TALK to a person about this. As this is my home, it is crucial to me to find a person who is 100% trustworthy and whom I feel good about bringing into my home. The house is self-contained, but the shower is shared with a downstairs roommate-tenant in the evenings who otherwise doesnt use the house except for the occasional dinner meal cooking. She is a very sweet, interesting, and considerate lady, a full-time public school teacher with a masters in education. I will consider a very well-behaved dog to tag along with the rental. An additional deposit will be required.

However, this is very close to having your own place due to the fact that Im gone more than half of the time and Im never home every night of any given week. Due to my commute, this keeps me away frequently. So, there is much more privacy. This is not the typical roommate situation due my renter having so much more privacy so this is why this is not posted under shared. Renting a decent 1 br in Los Gatos is much more than $1300 per month and there is also generally a huge deposit. Im only asking for a small deposit.

This lovely house on a quiet street is coming available because the current tenants are buying a home. The owner has no plans to move into or sell this property, so it could be yours for a long time. Why is this house such a good deal, where tenants tend to stay for numerous years at a time? (the previous tenant lived there 10 years) (a) Its within walking distance of two excellent public schools, Del Rey Elementary, two blocks, and Miramonte High, 1.2 miles. (b) The rent is generally lower than for comparable houses because there is a second unit downstairs, with its own entrance. Its long-term resident is a quiet, retired grandmother whom you will like. She shares the provided laundry machines, and has a space in the two-car garage. There is plenty of parking. Three bedrooms (one quite large) and two baths, all on one level. Large living room with vaulted ceiling and fireplace, dining area, eat-in kitchen with updated appliances. Beautiful views and plenty of sunlight. Large front patio and back deck, usable back yard with lawn and space for a garden. There is an automatic watering system already in place. Lots of storage space. Unfurnished (tenants furniture appears in the photos). The weather tends to be cooler in the summer, warmer in the winter than in Lafayette, Moraga, Walnut Creek, Concord, Pleasant Hill, Alamo, Danville, etc. because of Orindas being first in line for moderating sea breezes.

We are currently paying $1735 at our apartment for a 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment. When you renew its an increase of 2-5% increase which is really good for this spot, this apartment complex and any apartment for that matter on this street. They are currently asking $2213 for our 936 sq ft apartment. Everything in this apartment is up to date and very modern. It has laminate wood floors throughout other than the two bedrooms than has a light beige carpet. Plentiful storage in both bedroom and hallways. I cannot express how impressed I was with the storage in this apartment. Stainless steel appliances and granite in kitchen and bathroom vanity area. Generous patio area facing the creek and this apartment is on the first floor. Elevators in each building and laundry room on the third floor. Pets are also allowed with the traditional additional deposit and pet rent I believe. We have one parking spot with our place in the garage, not everyone gets that. There is a gate you would have to go through this complex during after office hours. Every building and amenety require a key to get it which I like and cameras in most of the common area. The gym is brand spanking new, common lobby area is great for studying and just hanging out, plenty of bbq spots and pool area is very nice as well. Unlike most apartment you only have 1 or 2 office staff and 1 maintanence person that wouldnt get to you until about a week later. Theres nightly patrol and security so your cars are safe just make sure you have your parking pass out. Theres so much office staff here and until late hours and the plenty of maintenance too and they fix everything quick. We would love to stay here but we have another baby on the way and it wouldnt be enough space for us four. We already notified the office of our early lease termination but thought wed help out and try to get it rented sooner than later. Plus was hoping anyone looking to rent a place here could get in cheap. Like I mentioned earlier this place is currently renting for $2213 and we are only paying $1735 and if you want to extend you still only pay anything close to the asking price now.

It is centrally located with affordable rents. The blocks closest to Market Street tend to be gritty with a fair share of homeless. However, the rest of the area has some nice pockets, with the best being closest to Nob Hill. Overall, the neighborhood is well located in SF and its popular among art students since you can find decent studios for reasonable prices. Its close to the theaters, Union Square, and there are some tasty ethnic restaurants. Photo by: Wikipedia User Aude "}, {"hasPost": 1.0, "head": "You want them, we have them!

Built on a grand scale and designed on two levels, this elegant house-like residence is perched high above vibrant Castro Street, overlooking both Noe and Eureka Valleys. The open, flowing floor plan is ideal for entertaining or simply retreating to the family room to enjoy the sweet garden outlook. Some of the many specialized features of this home include a gourment kitchen, nine and a half foot ceilings, custom bookshelves, and both gas and wood-burning fireplaces. The Master Bedroom has sweeping views, as well as a generous double closet and Master Bath. The striking hallway with illuminated, built-in glass shelves leads to the two large rear bedrooms, each of them stepping out to a charming rear patio. The property is semi-detached offering abundant natural light throughout, especially in the living room with its new gas fireplace. The front of the living room extends out far beyond neighboring homes, allowing panoramic views from both the front and sides of the living room that take in downtown SF and Eureka Valley on the left, Liberty Hill and beautiful Victorians across the street, and Noe Valley and the Bay to the right. The formal dining room and living room are grand in scale and design and connect seamlessly, making this home perfect for entertaining. Gorgeous deep brown walnut hardwood floors were recently installed in the living room, dining room, family room, master bedroom, and hallway, instilling a sense of grandeur and elegance throughout. The gourmet kitchen was remodeled in 2009 and features gorgeous granite countertops, maple cabinets, hi-end Thermador refrigerator and appliances, and an attractive new tiled floor, and opens to the rear family room. The family room, with a 60-inch Pioneer big screen TV and balcony, overlooks a serene flowering garden and is ideal for contemporary urban living. An attractive wine bar was added in 2010. The master bedroom has sweeping views of Downtown, Eureka Valley, and the neighboring Victorian Ladies. There is also generous closet space and a tiled master bath with separate tub and stall shower. The two rear bedrooms are nicely separated from the Master by a long, elegant hallway, with built-in illuminated glass shelves. All three bedrooms are very large -- each about 50% larger than normal comparable bedrooms. Both rear bedrooms have large closets and walkout access to the rear patio. This house-like residence is perched high above the flat block of vibrant Castro Street and comes largely furnished. Enjoy the convenient access of Muni (bus stop on end of same block) and also an elevator that brings you from street level to near the front door, so you can enjoy those amazing views without having to walk up numerous flights of stairs.

Our resident portal is set up to help you not only do normal daily tasks from the comfort of your home but also reduce the carbon footprint of day to day life. You do not have to drive to the Leasing Office to drop off your rent check....you dont even have to write a check! Simply go online to our resident portal and pay directly online. You can save time by submitting work orders on the resident portal, check your resident statement, you can meet your neighbors, sell items that you no longer need to your neighbors or purchase things from them. We also have electronic applications and leases, reducing paper usage. In addition to upgrading our apartments, one of the investments weve made to make the whole property more environmentally responsible is the installation of new solar electric panels. These solar panels not only power the shared space at the property but even provide renewable energy to the grid when the sun is shining brightest. They also reduce the propertys carbon footprint by the equivalent of taking every car at the property off of the road. We like to play our part when it comes to helping our residents live a more environmentally friendly lifestyle.

It is situated below an occupied upper apartment, so some tolerance for footfall noise from above at times is necessary. Offers cozy bedrooms, separate large shared closet/storage space, updated galley kitchen, dining/office space opening onto semi-private garden patio. The location is a great hillside spot offering panoramic San Francisco city and Bay and Alcatraz views and a safe/easy walk to downtown. Bus and ferry rendezvous points and the Golden Gate Bridge are just minutes away. One off-street parking space is provided, and on-street parking for guests and visitors is typically easy to come by. Access to washer/dryer and to garden with city views is shared with occupants of upper unit. Immediately adjacent to the house is a city park with tennis and basketball courts and dog run. Well-behaved pets are more than welcome (no extra charge, but might be factored into deposit). Gas, electric and water service are included in the monthly rent. Prospective tenants are simply asked to be respectful and responsible folks. That has been the general pattern with the long line of previous occupants, most of whom have departed as friends. Standard first and last months rent, along with approximate $1000 deposit, required. Proof of credit worthiness and personal references might also be requested.

It is centrally located with affordable rents. The blocks closest to Market Street tend to be gritty with a fair share of homeless. However, the rest of the area has some nice pockets, with the best being closest to Nob Hill. Overall, the neighborhood is well located in SF and its popular among art students since you can find decent studios for reasonable prices. Its close to the theaters, Union Square, and there are some tasty ethnic restaurants.

Its most popular attraction is Lombard Street, which is known as the crookedest street in the world due to its seven sharp turns. Similarly, many of the sidewalks are stairways due to the steepness of the streets of this neighborhood. Russian Hill does have a lot of popular restaurants and shops down Hyde Street, and is nearby North Beach, which has even more shops. With significantly less crime than other areas of San Francisco, Russian Hill is a great place to live. "}, {"hasPost": 1.0, "head": "Available Soon!
