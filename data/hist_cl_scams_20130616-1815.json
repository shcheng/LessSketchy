IT IS NOT EMPTY NOW. THIS IS SO YOU CAN ARRANGE HOUSING FOR SEPTEMBER SCHOOL YEAR. Rent is $1780 for two people. If more people, it is $55 more per person, maximum 4 (e.g., for 4 people it would be $1890 per month). I give $20 rebate each month if I have rent in my mailbox or deposited in my account by the 1st of the month - so rent will be cheaper if you are punctual. $2000 deposit, $100 for security gate keys. Ok to lease just for school year (e.g. Sept 2012 to June 2013), so you save Summer rent. If you need a place for Summer, this is not it. 2 bedroom, 2 full bathrooms. Living room, full kitchen. Big Balcony, Fireplace. Full size Washer and Dryer inside the condo - so, no paying for laundramats or community machines. The washer, dryer, dishwasher, garbage disposal, range hood and furnace were new as of 2011 - things are not too funky. It will have some furnishings: sofa, chairs, tables, bookshelves, desk, 2 beds, plates, utensils and pans in kitchen. Two covered parking places inside security gates. One master suite with bathroom with big shower and closets. Other bathroom is near living room with shower over bathtub. Quiet street but 5 blocks from Pacific Mall and 5 blocks from beach. Very close to transit to campus. Its at 124 Canfield Ave., second story. Security gates for entry to development. Ill be in town June 2, 12 p.m. to 2 p.m., if you want to look then. If you cant make that, possibly other times can be arranged. Sorry no pets. Reply to this ad, and leave an email address.
