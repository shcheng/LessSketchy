We stay active and busy, and get along great. We share lots of interests, including Burning Man, fitness, music, and candied ginger. Were comfortable and open, and we insist on clarity and honesty of communication in all things. We often have daytime and overnight visitors, and once in a while host larger gatherings. Impromptu dinner gatherings with two or three friends are not uncommon. Larger dinner and later night parties are less common, but also happen. See our personal descriptions below for more information.  If you have minimal tastefully eccentric furniture for common areas, there may be space. D\u00e9cor includes skylights, colorful walls, surprising knickknacks, toys, and a slight jungle atmosphere. Large, attractive, fenced front yard with fruit trees, raised beds for vegetables and flowers, lounge chairs, hammock space, and roses. Larger, lush backyard with more fruit trees, fire pit, and lots of space. Large garage with plenty of storage.  We share all the common areas, respect private space, and like to hang out together. We dont play our music loud that often, but once in a while a little well-crafted sound is welcome. We like to keep windows open when possible. Cleanliness is important, and we share all the cleaning duties. We clean up after ourselves, plus a little extra. We dont smoke tobacco inside the house, but youre welcome to do so in the front or back yards.  We love to cook and like to share food. Were not vegetarian, but eat lots of veggies.  Utilities included. First month deposit required.  One or two large, mature, clean, well-trained dogs might be welcome. Sweet cats that dont shed a lot are nice. Fish are nice, and also delicious. Well-trained plants are awesome.  Brad: Im a 30-year old communications professional working for a local non-profit pharmaceutical research organization.
