As you walk past the 3 car garage doors made of Honduras-Philippine Mahogany to the front door you will be amazed that the wall next to it is made of glass bricks. This is just the start of the many surprises in store for you. When you walk around the exterior of the first floor of this 3 story 5880 sq ft home, you will be delighted to discover the large rock garden with your very own waterfall and the spacious patio area that transitions into an extremely large, curved deck winding around the rear the home. It quickly becomes apparent that this home has privacy in a natural setting that includes mature oak, redwood, countless fruit trees, and your own hidden bocce ball court, and yet you are only 5 minutes away from both the freeway and downtown Santa Rosa. All this plus a 280 degree unobstructed view that seems to go on forever....especially at night when you cant tell where the valley lights end and the stars begin. When entering this home, its obvious that no expense was spared on the quality of fixtures and amenities, whether it be the indoor built-in BBQ pit, the elevator to all 3 floors plus two 2 spiral staircases, multiple fireplaces, zone controlled and energy efficient design throughout, pre-wiring for your own sound system, walk-in pantry, fire sprinkler system, or the Honduras/Philippine-Mahogany ceiling and floor - and, did we mention you have your very own indoor/outdoor herb garden next to the kitchen? On the subject of the kitchen, it has seen many successful professional cooking demonstrations, which tells you that If you cant cook it here...it cant be cooked. Throughout the remaining rooms of the main floor the light pours through floor to ceiling windows whether its in the dining room, family room, and breakfast area, emphasizing the openness of this unique floor plan. Whether taking the spiral stairs or the elevator to the upper floor, a crystal chandelier will light your way to the 3 master bedrooms with endless views, and private balconies, and all with their own master baths. This floor also provides the added luxury of your very own Jacuzzi and sauna. A special bonus of this 3 story home is the lower level where you will find totally independent living quarters for guests, family, or home staff. This includes an oversize living room, its own deck, bedroom, kitchen, full bathroom, laundry room, and its own entryway for total privacy. For those who especially love the outdoors and pets the home also has a 20FT fenced dog run with an automatic watering system. \u00a0 Features Bedrooms: 4 Bathrooms: 6 Parking Spaces: 3 Square Footage: 5,620 Agent Name: Accolade Management Broker: Accolade Inc Location Chaparral Ct Santa Rosa CA 95409 Created with vFlyer Marketing vFlyer Id: 204733035 ", "price": 5100.0}, {"hasPost": 1.0, "head": "\u2605\u2666\u2665Updated 3Bd/2Bth Livermore Home\u263b\u2665\u2666", "nbr": -1.0, "pid": 3890314390.0, "lon": -121.788652, "phone": 4083206446.0, "link": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/3890314390.html", "lat": 37.683181, "post": " $2,450 per month, 3 bedrooms, 2 full baths, 0 half baths.
