Your dog needs to be *extremely* good with small children; we sometimes leave our 3-year-old in the back alone to play. The sounds of our kids (and neighbors kids) are a bit of a dull roar in the background; previous tenants havent complained. Cable is attached but off; you can pay comcast to turn it on, you can try to connect to our spotty wi-fi, or we can figure something else out. You have your own entrance; you have your own address. You give us a 1-month deposit, which means the total move-in cost is $3000. We require a one-year lease (we *cannot* do month-to-month), starting August 1, 2013 and ending July 31, 2014.

Its most popular attraction is Lombard Street, which is known as the crookedest street in the world due to its seven sharp turns. Similarly, many of the sidewalks are stairways due to the steepness of the streets of this neighborhood. Russian Hill does have a lot of popular restaurants and shops down Hyde Street, and is nearby North Beach, which has even more shops. With significantly less crime than other areas of San Francisco, Russian Hill is a great place to live.

It is centrally located with affordable rents. The blocks closest to Market Street tend to be gritty with a fair share of homeless. However, the rest of the area has some nice pockets, with the best being closest to Nob Hill. Overall, the neighborhood is well located in SF and its popular among art students since you can find decent studios for reasonable prices.

I would like to be able to break my lease, and do it by July 1st. This is where you come in. The rent will be around 2200 per month with a private parking spot included, which is a good deal considering the neighborhood. And right off the bat, let me say that the landlord will not allow pets of any kind that are mammalian. Sorry. I thought it was lame, too, but when i saw the spot i made the compromise. The apt: Huge one bedroom, around 1500 square feet. Cool bathroom, the tub and shower are separated. Lots o storage space. Laundry on site. Hers/His closets in bedroom. Really cute, actually. Huge dining room, large windows. Monstrous living room with operable fireplace, large windows. Even bigger outdoor patio that gets great sunlight. Did i mention that the upstairs neighbors are pretty badass? Turn of the century building, which means amazing hardwood floors, high ceilings with ornate crown moldings- and the fireplace is even more intricate. I just installed a raised garden out front and had specialized soil (a la merde) delivered for growing vegetables. Take my word, it will cause your veggies to grow so fast you prob should never stand in it for fear of being impaled by some fast upshoot tomato plant or radicchio stem. Seriously. But not really. It is really good soil, though. Paid a LOT to get it here. And you get it for FREE!! And did i mention its in probably the safest, quietest neighborhood in Oakland, just steps away from the lake and your next run resplendent with flocking geese and the bright Oakland sun reflecting off the lake warming your face and soul as you realize how freakin much you love your new apt and the area!!! Did i mention that? Anywho, the reason i want out is that my fiancee and i split after getting the place to settle down in. Alas, the memories. Alas, i want to be back near all mee buddies in San Francisco. It goes on, but not here. All i want you to do is email me, serious inquiries only, to set up a time to come look at it. I work a LOT, so i wont respond immediately. Dont take this personally or get worried. Anyone is capable of having this spot, but i know the landlord would like someone with credite excellente! Even better references! She likes couples, too. Apparently they are like......more reliable or something. Go figure. The deposit is 4000.00 smackeroos. So, the move in would be around 6300.00. And, if you like, you could buy my huge sectional couch i bought specifically for this apt. I paid 1300 for it. You could pay 600.00. Its literally 8 mos old, and pretty much never gets used because i avoid home as much as possible due to the aforementioned dissolution of....etc. Exeunt!!
